once logged in run the command 

sudo usermod -aG input $USER

After running this Reboot/Logout and login.

Then you can open a terminal and run 

waybar &amp;

the result will be terrible but we will add my Config files later on.

we will need the fonts 

sudo pacman -S otf-font-awesome ttf-arimo-nerd noto-fonts

after running that run waybar again (optinal)

now we copy the config files to out destination.

mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar
cp /etc/xdg/waybar/* ~/.config/waybar/

now we can add our config files if the config has moved over.

just copy Config, style and scripts folder and it should look nice.
